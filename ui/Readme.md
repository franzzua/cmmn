## UI library

Simple but reach components based on WebComponents, uhtml and cellx.

component can be generated by comman `cmmn gen my-comp ./components`

it will generate 3 files: `my-comp.component.ts`, `my-comp.template.ts` and `my-comp.style.less`

* Component is a class that extends HtmlComponent which extends HtmlElement byself with simple hack that prevents `Illegal constructor` error risen.<br/>
  So, your component and referenced element in DOM are equal. <br/> 
Component should have `get State(): IState` and `Actions: IEvents`, that will be used in template. 
* Template is a just JS function like
<code>
(html, state, events) => html`<div onclick=${events.someAction()}>${state}</div>`
</code>. So you need not any compilers-transpilers. 
* Style is a just .less or .css file that will be injected in head.
